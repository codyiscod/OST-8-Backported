<p align="center">Yes, I have ported <i><b>EVERY</b></i> OST 8 song to <b>1.34.5+</b>!</p>

### Working features:
- Every Beatmap has been ported (including the one-handed modes!)
- Every Lightshow has been ported
- Map colors are fully accurate to OST 8's color scheme
- All song data is correct (mappers, lighters, song information, etc.)

### What's broken: <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/813065214245077013.webp?size=22">
- __The lightshows will always be inaccurate__ because the "Cube" environment doesn't exist. So, I used the "Weave" environment instead.
- __These songs cannot be uploaded to BeatSaver.__ That means no leaderboards, and multiplayer might not work either.
- __Walls can sometimes be too low__ because the new wall positions are not supported
- __An OST 8 Playlist would have to be created yourself__ because these songs are not on BeatSaver, meaning the IDs won't match up with other game instances (from my testing)
