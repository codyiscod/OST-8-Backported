### <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1207373069891666002.webp?size=22"> Working features!
- Every Beatmap has been ported (including the one-handed modes!)
- Every Lightshow has been ported
- Map colors are fully accurate to OST 8's color scheme
- All song data is correct (mappers, lighters, song information, etc.)

### <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/813065214245077013.webp?size=22"> What's broken?
- **The new "Cube" environment doesn't exist.** The "Weave" environment is used instead.
- **These songs cannot be uploaded to BeatSaver.** That means no leaderboards, no transferring playlists, and no multiplayer.
- **Walls can sometimes be too low** because the new wall positions are not supported
- **Songs have to be added to playlists in-game.** Not sure why, but BSManager doesn't like it :(
