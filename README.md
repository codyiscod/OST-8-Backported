### <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1207373069891666002.webp?size=22"> Working features!
- Every Beatmap has been ported (including the one-handed modes!)
- Every Lightshow has been ported
- Map colors are fully accurate to OST 8's color scheme
- All song data is correct (mappers, lighters, song information, etc.)

### <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/813065214245077013.webp?size=22"> What's broken?
- **The new "Cube" environment doesn't exist.** The "Weave" environment is used instead.
- **These songs cannot be uploaded to BeatSaver.** That means no leaderboards, no transferring playlists, and no multiplayer.
- **Walls can sometimes be too low** because the new wall positions are not supported
- **Songs have to be added to playlists in-game.** Not sure why, but BSManager doesn't like it :(

# "how to install?" <img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgflip.com%2F2%2Fa2stqb.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=aaa36fb057b7c980fa570df0a9c568d6a763f1b1093e7fb44a005825b7bc5cbe" width="36px">
1. Head to the [Latest Release](https://github.com/codyiscod/OST-8-Backported/releases/latest) page and download the `Source Code`
2. Extract the downloaded file, and you'll see a bunch of `.zip` files. Then...

    - **ModsBeforeFriday —** Open up the website, connect your headset, and then drag-and-drop each `.zip` file onto the page
    - **BSManager —** Drag-and-drop all of the `.zip` files into the Maps section
    - **Unmodded PCVR —** Copy the `.zip` files into your game's `CustomLevels` folder, then extract each file into its own folder
    - **Unmodded Quest** and **PSVR2** unfortunately don't support custom songs, so those don't work 😔

If you'd like to create a playlist, I've included an `ost8-cover.png` file, which you can use for your Playlist cover.
Remember, songs ***need*** to be added to playlists ***in-game*** for whatever reason!
